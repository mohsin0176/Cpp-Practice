# Simple String Reverse 

This program takes an input string or phrase and gives the reverse, e.g. 

```
./string_reverse hello
Your input string was: "hello"
"hello" reversed is: "olleh"
```


Program is called by: `./string_reverse <string>` where `<string>` is the user input string. For multiple word phrases, please place the input string in quotation marks e.g. 

```
./string_reverse "hello hello"
Your input string was: "hello hello"
"hello hello" reversed is: "olleh olleh"
```
